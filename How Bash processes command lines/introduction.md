## Introduction

Bash is a shell, which is a command-line interface used to interact with the operating system. When you type a command into the Bash shell, it goes through a series of steps to process the command line:

1. Parsing: Bash first parses the command line to break it down into individual components, such as the command, options, arguments, and redirects.

2. Expansion: Next, Bash expands any special characters and performs variable substitution. For example, it expands wildcards like "*" and "?", and replaces variables with their values.

3. Execution: Finally, Bash executes the command, either by running a built-in command or by executing an external program. If the command is an external program, Bash searches the directories listed in the PATH environment variable for an executable file with the same name as the command.

Throughout this process, Bash uses various environment variables and shell settings to control its behavior. For example, the PATH variable specifies the directories to search for executables, and the PS1 variable defines the prompt that appears when Bash is ready for input.
