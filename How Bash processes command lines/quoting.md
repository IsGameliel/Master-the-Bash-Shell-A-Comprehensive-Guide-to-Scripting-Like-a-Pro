In Bash, quoting is a way to protect special characters and preserve their literal meanings, rather than allowing them to be interpreted by the shell. There are three types of quotes in Bash: single quotes (''), double quotes ("") and backticks (` `).

1. Single quotes: If a string is enclosed in single quotes, all characters within the quotes are treated literally. This means that variables and special characters are not expanded, and their literal value is used instead.

Example: 
```
echo 'Hello $USER, today is $(date)'
```
Output:
```
Hello $USER, today is $(date)
```

2. Double quotes: If a string is enclosed in double quotes, variables are expanded and their values are used, but special characters such as "$" and "`" are preserved if they are escaped with a backslash.

Example:
```
echo "Hello $USER, today is $(date)"
```
Output:
```
Hello <username>, today is <date>
```

3. Backticks: Backticks are used to execute a command and substitute the output of the command into the string. They are equivalent to the $() syntax.

Example:
```
echo "The current directory is: `pwd`"
```
Output:
```
The current directory is: /path/to/current/directory
```

In summary, quoting is used in Bash to control the interpretation of special characters and preserve their literal meaning. Single quotes are used to disable all interpretation, double quotes are used to enable variable expansion and command substitution, and backticks are used for command substitution.
