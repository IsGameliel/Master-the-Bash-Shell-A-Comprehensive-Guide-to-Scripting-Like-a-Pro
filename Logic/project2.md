Project on case statements
Sure! Here's an example project on how to use the case statement in Bash:

## Project: Menu Selection Using Case Statement

### Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple menu system using the case statement in Bash.

### Requirements

- A Bash script that presents a menu to the user and allows the user to select an option.
- The menu should include at least three options.
- The script should respond appropriately to the user's selection.
- The script should include error handling for invalid selections.
- The script should exit gracefully when the user chooses to exit.

### Solution

Here's an example Bash script that meets the requirements:

```
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    clear
    echo "Menu:"
    echo "1. Option 1"
    echo "2. Option 2"
    echo "3. Option 3"
    echo "0. Exit"
    read -p "Enter your choice: " choice

    case $choice in
        1)
            echo "You chose Option 1"
            read -p "Press enter to continue..."
            ;;
        2)
            echo "You chose Option 2"
            read -p "Press enter to continue..."
            ;;
        3)
            echo "You chose Option 3"
            read -p "Press enter to continue..."
            ;;
        0)
            echo "Exiting..."
            exit 0
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid choice. Please try again."
            read -p "Press enter to continue..."
            ;;
    esac
done
```

This script presents a menu to the user and allows the user to select an option using the read command. It uses the case statement to determine the appropriate action to take based on the user's selection. If the user chooses an invalid option, the script displays an error message and prompts the user to try again. The script exits gracefully when the user chooses to exit.

You can customize the menu options and actions to suit your needs. The case statement provides a flexible and powerful way to create menus and respond to user input in Bash.
