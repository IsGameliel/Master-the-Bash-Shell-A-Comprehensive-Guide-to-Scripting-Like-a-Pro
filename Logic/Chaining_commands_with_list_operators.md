In Bash, you can chain multiple commands together using list operators. These operators allow you to control the flow of execution based on the success or failure of each command. Here are the list operators that you can use:

1. `;` - Executes commands sequentially, regardless of whether the previous command succeeded or failed. For example:

```
mkdir mydir; cd mydir; touch myfile
```

This command creates a directory called `mydir`, navigates into it, and creates a file called `myfile`.

2. `&&` - Executes the next command only if the previous command succeeded. For example:

```
ls myfile && echo "File exists"
```

This command lists the contents of the current directory and then prints "File exists" only if a file called `myfile` exists.

3. `||` - Executes the next command only if the previous command failed. For example:

```
rm myfile || echo "File not found"
```

This command attempts to remove a file called `myfile`, and if the file does not exist, it prints "File not found".

4. `&` - Executes the command in the background, allowing you to continue working in the shell while the command runs. For example:

```
sleep 10 &
```

This command puts the `sleep` command in the background and sleeps for 10 seconds, allowing you to continue working in the shell while it runs.

Note that you can use these operators together to create complex command chains. Here's an example:

```
gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c && ./myprogram || echo "Compilation failed"
```

This command compiles a C program called `myprogram.c` and runs it only if the compilation succeeds. If the program fails to compile, it prints "Compilation failed".
