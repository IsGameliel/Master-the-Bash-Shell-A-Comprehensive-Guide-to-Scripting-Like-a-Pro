# Setting up secure script permission

Setting up secure script permissions in Bash is essential to protect the script from unauthorized access and execution. Here are the steps to set up secure script permissions in Bash:

1. Determine the user or users who need to execute the script. This could be a specific user, a group of users, or all users on the system.

2. Set the ownership of the script to the appropriate user or group using the chown command. For example, to set the ownership of a script named "myscript.sh" to the user "john", use the following command:

```
$ sudo chown john myscript.sh
```
3. Set the permissions on the script to restrict access to only the user or group that needs to execute it. The most secure permissions are 700, which allow only the owner to execute the script. To set the permissions to 700, use the following command:

```
$ sudo chmod 700 myscript.sh
```
4. If the script needs to be executed by multiple users, you can set the permissions to 750, which allows the owner and members of the same group to execute the script. To set the permissions to 750, use the following command:

```
$ sudo chmod 750 myscript.sh
```
5. If the script needs to be executed by all users on the system, you can set the permissions to 755, which allows all users to execute the script. To set the permissions to 755, use the following command:

```
$ sudo chmod 755 myscript.sh
```
6. If the script contains sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, you should consider encrypting the script using tools such as GPG or openssl. This will protect the script from being read by unauthorized users even if they gain access to the file.

Overall, setting up secure script permissions involves setting the ownership and permissions on the script to restrict access to only authorized users. It's an essential step in protecting the script and its contents from unauthorized access and execution.
