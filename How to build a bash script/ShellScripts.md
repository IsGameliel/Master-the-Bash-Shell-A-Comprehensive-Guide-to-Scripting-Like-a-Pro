# Shell vs Scripts

Shells and scripts are two different concepts in the world of programming. <br>

A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) program that interprets user commands and executes them. It allows users to interact with the operating system by <br>typing commands and receiving output in the terminal. Shells are used to launch programs, manage files and directories, and perform system <br>administration tasks.<br>

On the other hand, a script is a program that is written in a programming language and executed by a shell. Scripts are used to automate tasks or perform complex operations. They can be used to create new commands or to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.<br>

In other words, a shell is an interactive program that allows users to interact with the operating system, while a script is a program that can be executed by a shell to automate tasks or perform operations. Shells and scripts are complementary to each other, and both are essential tools for developers and system administrators.
