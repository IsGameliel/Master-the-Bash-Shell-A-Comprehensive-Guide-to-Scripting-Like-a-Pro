## Command substitution

here are a few examples of command substitution in Bash:

1. Assigning the output of a command to a variable

You can use command substitution to assign the output of a command to a variable. For example, to store the current date in a variable called `mydate`, you can use the following command:

```
mydate=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
echo $mydate
```

Here, the `date` command with the `%Y-%m-%d` format option outputs the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". The output of this command is assigned to the `mydate` variable using the `$()` syntax. Finally, the `echo` command is used to display the value of the `mydate` variable.

2. Using the output of a command in a command line argument

You can use command substitution to pass the output of a command as an argument to another command. For example, to list all the files in the current directory that were modified in the last 24 hours, you can use the following command:

```
ls -l $(find . -type f -mtime -1)
```

Here, the `find` command searches for all regular files (`-type f`) in the current directory and its subdirectories that were modified in the last 24 hours (`-mtime -1`). The output of this command is passed as an argument to the `ls` command using the `$()` syntax. The `-l` option is used to display the file details in a long format.

3. Using command substitution to create a file with a timestamp

You can use command substitution to create a file with a timestamp in its name. For example, to create a file with a name that includes the current date and time, you can use the following command:

```
touch myfile_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).txt
```

Here, the `touch` command is used to create a file with a name that includes the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS". The `date` command with the `%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S` format option outputs the current date and time in this format. The output of this command is then substituted into the `touch` command using the `$()` syntax.
