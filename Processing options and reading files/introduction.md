In Bash, there are several ways to process files and read their contents. Here are a few examples:

1. Using cat command: The `cat` command is used to concatenate and display the contents of one or more files on the standard output. For example, `cat file1.txt file2.txt` will display the contents of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` on the standard output.

2. Using redirection: Bash allows you to redirect the standard input and output of a command. For example, `cat < file.txt` will read the contents of `file.txt` and display it on the standard output. Similarly, `cat file.txt > output.txt` will write the contents of `file.txt` to `output.txt`.

3. Using while loop: You can also use a while loop to read the contents of a file line by line. For example, `while read line; do echo $line; done < file.txt` will read the contents of `file.txt` line by line and display it on the standard output.

4. Using awk: The `awk` command is a powerful tool for processing text files. You can use it to extract specific fields from a file, perform calculations, and more. For example, `awk '{print $1}' file.txt` will print the first field of each line in `file.txt`.

5. Using sed: The `sed` command is another tool for processing text files. It is commonly used for text substitution and file transformations. For example, `sed 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt` will replace all occurrences of "foo" with "bar" in `file.txt`.

These are just a few examples of the many ways you can process and read files in Bash.
