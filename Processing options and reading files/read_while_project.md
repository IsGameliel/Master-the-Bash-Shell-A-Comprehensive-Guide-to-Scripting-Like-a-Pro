Sure, I can help you with a project on the read while loop in Bash.

The read command in Bash is used to read a line from standard input (stdin) and store it into a variable. The while loop is used to execute a set of commands repeatedly as long as a condition is true. Combining the read command and the while loop can be very useful for processing data input by the user or from a file.

Here's an example project that uses the read while loop in Bash:

Project: Summing Numbers

In this project, you will write a Bash script that reads a series of numbers from the user, calculates their sum, and then displays the result.

Here are the steps to complete this project:

1. Create a new Bash script file called "sum.sh" using your favorite text editor.

2. Add a shebang line at the top of the script to indicate that it should be interpreted by the Bash shell:

   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

3. Add a prompt to the user to enter a number:

   ```
   echo "Enter a number:"
   ```

4. Use the read command to read the user's input and store it into a variable called "number":

   ```
   read number
   ```

5. Create a variable called "sum" and set it to 0:

   ```
   sum=0
   ```

6. Use a while loop to repeat the following steps as long as the user keeps entering numbers:

   a. Add the value of "number" to "sum".

   ```
   sum=$((sum + number))
   ```

   b. Prompt the user to enter another number.

   ```
   echo "Enter another number (or press Ctrl+D to exit):"
   ```

   c. Read the user's input and store it into the "number" variable.

   ```
   read number
   ```

7. After the user has finished entering numbers, display the sum:

   ```
   echo "The sum of the numbers is: $sum"
   ```

8. Save the file and make it executable:

   ```
   chmod +x sum.sh
   ```

9. Run the script:

   ```
   ./sum.sh
   ```

10. Enter a series of numbers and press Enter after each one. When you are finished, press Ctrl+D to exit the while loop and display the sum of the numbers.

Here is an example of what the output might look like:

```
Enter a number:
5
Enter another number (or press Ctrl+D to exit):
10
Enter another number (or press Ctrl+D to exit):
15
Enter another number (or press Ctrl+D to exit):
^D
The sum of the numbers is: 30
```

I hope this project helps you understand how to use the read while loop in Bash. Good luck!
