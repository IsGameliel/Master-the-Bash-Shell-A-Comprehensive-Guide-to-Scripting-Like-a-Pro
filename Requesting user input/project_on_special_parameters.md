# Project 2

Sure, I can give you an example project on special parameters in Bash.

Project Title: Analyzing Script Arguments with Special Parameters in Bash

Project Description:
In this project, you will write a Bash script that analyzes the command-line arguments passed to it using special parameters. The script will take a list of filenames as arguments and will perform various operations on them, such as checking if they exist, counting the number of files, and displaying their contents.

Project Requirements:
1. A Bash script that takes a list of filenames as arguments.
2. The script should check if each file exists and display an error message if it does not.
3. The script should count the number of files passed as arguments.
4. The script should display the contents of each file passed as an argument.
5. The script should use special parameters such as $1, $2, $#, $@, and $? to perform the above tasks.
6. The script should be well-commented and should include a brief explanation of each special parameter used.

Project Implementation:

1. First, create a new Bash script file called analyze-args.sh.
2. Use the special parameter $# to check if the script was passed any arguments. If no arguments were passed, display an error message and exit the script.
3. Use a for loop and the special parameter $@ to iterate over each argument passed to the script. For each argument, use the special parameter $1 to check if the file exists. If it does not exist, display an error message and skip to the next argument.
4. Use the special parameter $# to count the number of files passed as arguments and display the count.
5. Use a while loop and the special parameter $@ to display the contents of each file passed as an argument. Use the cat command to display the contents of each file.
6. Use the special parameter $? to check the exit status of the last executed command (the cat command). If the exit status is non-zero, display an error message.
7. Add comments to explain each special parameter used in the script.

Sample Script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# check if the script was passed any arguments
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Error: no arguments passed."
  exit 1
fi

# iterate over each argument and check if the file exists
for file in "$@"; do
  if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "Error: file '$file' does not exist."
    continue
  fi
done

# count the number of files passed as arguments
num_files=$#
echo "Number of files: $num_files"

# display the contents of each file
while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
  cat "$1"
  # check the exit status of the cat command
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: could not display contents of file '$1'."
  fi
  shift
done
```

To use the script, save it as analyze-args.sh and make it executable using the command `chmod +x analyze-args.sh`. Then, run the script with a list of filenames as arguments:

```
./analyze-args.sh file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

The script will check if each file exists, count the number of files, and display the contents of each file. If any errors occur, the script will display an error message.
