# Special parameters

In bash, special parameters are variables that have special meanings and are set by the shell itself. Here are some commonly used special parameters in bash along with examples:

1. $0 - The name of the current script or program.
Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "The name of this script is: $0"
```
Output:
```
The name of this script is: script.sh
```

2. $1-$9 - The first through ninth command-line arguments passed to the script or program.
Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "The first argument is: $1"
echo "The second argument is: $2"
echo "The third argument is: $3"
```
If this script is called with `./script.sh foo bar baz`, the output will be:
```
The first argument is: foo
The second argument is: bar
The third argument is: baz
```

3. $# - The number of command-line arguments passed to the script or program.
Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "There are $# arguments."
```
If this script is called with `./script.sh foo bar baz`, the output will be:
```
There are 3 arguments.
```

4. $* - All the command-line arguments passed to the script or program as a single string, separated by spaces.
Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "All the arguments are: $*"
```
If this script is called with `./script.sh foo bar baz`, the output will be:
```
All the arguments are: foo bar baz
```

5. $$ - The process ID (PID) of the current shell.
Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "The PID of the current shell is: $$"
```
Output:
```
The PID of the current shell is: 1234
```

6. $? - The exit status of the last executed command.
Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
ls /some/nonexistent/directory
echo "The exit status of the last command was: $?"
```
Output:
```
ls: cannot access '/some/nonexistent/directory': No such file or directory
The exit status of the last command was: 2
```

7. $! - The PID of the last background command executed.
Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
sleep 10 &
echo "The PID of the last background command was: $!"
```
Output:
```
The PID of the last background command was: 1234
```
