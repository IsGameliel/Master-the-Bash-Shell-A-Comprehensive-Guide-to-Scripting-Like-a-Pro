1. Write a script that takes a filename as an argument and counts the number of lines, words, and characters in the file. The script should print out the counts in the following format: "The file <filename> has <line_count> lines, <word_count> words, and <character_count> characters."

2. Write a script that takes a directory name as an argument and recursively counts the number of files and directories in that directory. The script should print out the counts in the following format: "The directory <directory_name> contains <file_count> files and <directory_count> directories."

3. Write a script that takes a number as an argument and prints out whether the number is even or odd.

4. Write a script that takes two numbers as arguments and prints out their sum, difference, product, and quotient (if the second number is not zero). If the second number is zero, the script should print out an error message.
