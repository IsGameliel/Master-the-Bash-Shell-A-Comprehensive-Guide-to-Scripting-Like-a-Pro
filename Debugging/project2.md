ShellCheck is a popular tool for identifying common errors and potential pitfalls in shell scripts written in Bash or other shell languages. Here's a project idea that you can implement using ShellCheck in Bash:

Project: Bash script linting tool using ShellCheck

Description:
You will create a Bash script that uses ShellCheck to perform linting on other Bash scripts. The script will take a filename or directory as input and check all Bash scripts in that directory (or the specified file) for syntax errors, common mistakes, and potential issues.

Steps:
1. Install ShellCheck on your system (if not already installed). ShellCheck is available on most Linux distributions and can be installed using package managers such as apt, yum, or dnf.

2. Write a Bash script that takes a filename or directory path as input. You can use the `read` command to prompt the user for input.

3. Check if the input is a file or directory using the `test` command. If it is a file, check if it is a Bash script using the `file` command. If it is a directory, use the `find` command to locate all Bash scripts in that directory.

4. Use ShellCheck to perform linting on the Bash scripts. You can use the `shellcheck` command to check the scripts for syntax errors and potential issues. You can also use the `-f` option to specify the format of the output (e.g. plain text, JSON, etc.).

5. Display the results to the user. You can use the `echo` command to display the results in the terminal. You can also use color codes to highlight errors and warnings.

6. Optional: You can add additional functionality to the script, such as ignoring certain warnings or errors, specifying the output format, or automatically correcting common mistakes.

Example usage:
```
$ ./lint.sh myfile.sh
myfile.sh:3:1: warning: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting. [SC2086]
myfile.sh:4:1: error: Expected a variable name. [SC1070]
myfile.sh:5:1: warning: Use $(...) instead of legacy backticked `...`. [SC2006]
```

```
$ ./lint.sh mydirectory
./script1.sh:3:1: warning: Use #!/bin/bash instead of #!/bin/sh for Bash scripts. [SC2148]
./script2.sh:1:1: error: Missing shebang. Specify a shebang to define the shell. [SC2144]
./subdirectory/script3.sh:5:1: warning: Use more quotes around this variable reference. [SC2126]
```

Note: This is just an example project idea. You can modify and expand upon it as you see fit.
